HashMaps:-

==> Need to find the hashcode() of the object and store it in corresponding bucket.
==> If two objects have their hashcode() not equal, it means that objects can never be equal.
==> If the hashcode() of two objects is equal, then the object may or may not be equal.
==> There could be null to null mapping also.
==> We always need to remember to override the hashcode() and equals() of an object that we need to use in the hashmap especially in the key.
